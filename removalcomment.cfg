Thank you for your submission to /r/NotTheOnion!  Unfortunately, your submission was automatically since your submission's title appears to be different from the headline of the article you submitted.  Submissions with altered titles are not permitted, all titles must be the headline from the article, copy-and-pasted.  /n /n * Do not add **periods or quotation marks** to the title, or change the style of quotation marks used (for example, changing single quotes to double quotes). This will cause your submission to be automatically removed, as the title has been altered. /n /n * Do not use the **suggest title button**.  Instead, copy-and-paste the article's title *directly* from the link you are submitting.  The suggest title button's output is often different from the article's actual title. /n /n * Make sure that you're checking the title on the **desktop version** of the website, not the mobile version.  Only the desktop versions of articles are allowed, and the title can sometimes differ between versions. /n /n If you'd like to resubmit with the correct title, remember that all other rules must be followed as well, in addition to the title being correct.  For more information on our rules, check out /r/NotTheOnion/w/NTO101. /n /n *I'm a bot, and I'm currently in beta.  If you believe your submission was removed incorrectly, please* [*send us a modmail*](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2Fnottheonion) *so we can look in to it and correct any errors. Thanks!*
